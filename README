This repo is a frankenstein version of the SWC git-novice lessons (v5.3 - https://github.com/swcarpentry/git-novice) and and an earlier version of the git novice materials (https://github.com/erdavenport/2014-09-18-chicago/tree/gh-pages/novice/git).
Specifically, this version eliminates the paired collaboration lesson and instead returns to self collaboration.
